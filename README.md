# Network-Construction-for-face-expression-recognition

## Objective
- In this project, I collect various face expression datasets and accumulate them together to perform model training
- With this dataset, I perform experiments on constructing an architecture of the neural network to achieve the best result possible
- This project does not differ from any other experiments previously committed and serves only as my self-interest in machine learning in general.
## Workflow
I am gonna follow a certain sequence of development stages:
 - Experimenting stage
 - Deployment stage
 - API development
 - Application development
